<h1>
    <u>Assignment 5</u>
    <br>
    by Johannes Jacob, Tobias Ludwig and Mona Timmermann
</h1>

<div class="page-wrap">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    We have focused on two research questions and used different ways of visualising the data
    on crimes in the city of San Francisco to provide answers to these questions.
    The case and data was provided by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime">Kaggle</a>
    and ranges from 01/01/2003 to 13/05/2015.

    <h2>Research Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Are there differences in the amount of crimes during the different hours of the day?</li>
        <li>Are there areas of San Francisco where more crimes are committed than in other areas?</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Visualisations and Insights</h2>

    <h3> a. The role of the time of the day</h3>
    In the following graph one can see that there is a difference in the amount
    of crimes throughout the day. As expected, there are more crimes being committed
    in the afternoon and evenings, less during the late night/early morning. However,
    it is not yet clear whether there are also differences in the kind of crimes
    throughout the day. <br><br>

        <svg style="width:800px; height:400px" id="time_profile"></svg>
    </div>

    <h3> b. Location of crimes in San Francisco</h3>
    The following map is rather basic and not interactive. It depicts where crimes have been committed in San Francisco
    and shows clearly that the more north-eastern districts are more affected by crimes, but does not show a clear
    difference between the types of crimes (depicted by different colours) that have been committed.
    The reader can check the types of crimes but hovering over the dots in the map and reading the line
    underneath.<br><br>
    <svg style="width:1200px; height:1000px" id="map"></svg>
    <br>
    <!--<i>Meaning of colour:</i> <br>-->
    The committed crime was: <span id="TypeOfCrime">___________________</span>


    <h3> c. Location of crimes in San Francisco with Interactivity</h3>
    The following map allows to select only a subset of the different kinds of crimes through a
    combo box to get a feeling of the kind of crimes which occur in different
    areas of San Francisco and allows to find out which crimes a dot refers to
    by hovering over the circles in the map. It is an adaption of the previously
    created map.<br><br>
    <label for="crimeselection">Filter crimes by category:</label>
    <select id="crimeselection" onchange="crimeCATS(this)">
        <option>Choose a crime category</option>
    </select>

    <script>
        // Populate Combobox
        var select = document.getElementById("crimeselection");
        var options = CATS;
        for(var i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {
            var opt = options[i];
            var el = document.createElement("option");
            el.textContent = opt;
            el.value = opt;
            select.appendChild(el);
        }
        // Callback for Comboboxes:
        function crimeCATS(selectObject) {
            crimeselection = selectObject.value;           
            drawCATSMap(crime_points, crimeselection);
        }
    </script>
    <svg style="width:1200px; height:1000px" id="map_selection"></svg>


    <h3> d. Change in crime categories over the hours</h3>
    The following visualisation helps to find out whether there has been a change
    in the kinds of crimes that occur over the different hours.<br><br>
