<h2>Two Visualizations from the Internet</h2>

<ol>

    <li>
        <h3>The first visualization shows why buses bunch by enabling users to delay one of two buses:</h3>
        <a href="http://setosa.io/bus/">Link to first visualization</a>
        <ul>
            <li> PRO: clear image, easy to understand, simple message </li>
            <li> CON: unrealistic setting due to simplicity, buses not really in focus </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>The second visualization shows locations of AirBnB listings in Barcelona over the years:</h3>
        <a href="http://www.dwarshuis.com/various/airbnb/barcelona/">Link to second visualization</a>
        <ul>
            <li> PRO: easy to understand, one can not only see an increase in numbers but also changes in areas; speed/scale/start year adjustable </li>
            <li> CON: distracting quotes/quizz popping up, sound immediately, colouring; anonymization by AirBnb resulting in 150 meter difference </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>


<h2>Ideas for projects</h2>

<h3>Tobi</h3>
<p> Horizon 2020 is a project of the EU for funding research, development and innovation in the range of 2014-2020. </p>
<ol>
    <li>How is this money distributed over countries, who profits the most? How many proposals are accepted/rejected?</li>
    <li>Data is available at the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/projectresults/index.html">official EU website</a>, however their visualizations are a bit overwhelming.</li>
    <li>Data could visualized by a heat-colored map of Europe, interactive elements would be a slider for time and extra-details on countries that pop up when hovering over them.</li>
    <li>Audience could be students who are considering to move to a European country for doing their PhD or the like.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Mona</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Creating an interactive map showing (from) where Erasmus students are going on exchange</li>
    <li><a href="http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset?q=erasmus&ext_boolean=all&sort=">One can find some data on Erasmus movements here </a></li>
    <li>Goal: demonstrating preferences and changes over the years</li>
    <li>Audience: universities, students, gov. institutions, general public</li>
</ol>

<h3>Johannes</h3>
<p>Recently I worked on a project examining the influence of UN peacekeeping missions on refugee flows to Europe. As this was only a strict quantitative analyis the reader could only rely on results from regressions depicted in tables. In a visulization project I would like to implement the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Map refugees flows from African conflict areas to Europe. Preferbly in a stream kind of manner.</li>
    <li>Add an interactive bar that allows the user to change the number of UN personnel deployed to a conflict and see the reactions in the refugee streams.</li>
    <li>Add circles with the number of deaths in a conflict such that the spectator is able to sense the conflict brutality by the size of the circle.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the data is available online at the download site of the <a href = "http://ucdp.uu.se/">Uppsala Conflict Data Program</a>.</p>
