<h2> Trump Family Tree</h2>
<h3> Assignment 3: Johannes Jacob, Mona Timmermann, Tobias Ludwig</h3>

<p>
    The following visualisation shows a family tree created for the Trump family based on <a
        href="https://wouterboomsma.github.io/ide2017/week49/trump_family.json">this</a> data.
    <br>
    The goal was to create an easy-to-read tree. We have made the following decisions:
<ul>
    <li>Partners have been put on their own level for simplification</li>
    <li>Links between people's names as basic easy-to-read lines</li>
    <li>Differentiation between Husband/Wife and Parent/Child relationship by color</li>
    <li>Legend to explain meaning of colours</li>

</ul>
<br>
Possible improvements could be:
<ul>
    <li> Having partners on a subordinated level can be confusing at first. Something similar to <a
            href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3b/c7/65/3bc7659f4e0bd449b79664291fbfde6f--donald-trump-children-donald-trump-family.jpg">this</a>
        may be nicer.
    </li>
    <li> The visualisation seems too wide and should probably be narrowed a little.
    <li> Adding more information, e.g.:
        <ol>
            <li> photo of corresponding person</li>
            <li> current relationship status (married, divorced)</li>
            <li> age and/or birthday</li>
            <li> current job</li>
            <li> place of residence</li>

        </ol>
    <li> The information mentioned above could be added based on an event listener, e.g. a mouse click or mouseover.
    </li>
</ul>
