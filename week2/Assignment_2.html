<h2><a id="mot">1. Motivation</a></h2>
    <p>For the past decades the concern about climate change is one the most pressing issues in global politics. The vast majority of nations is convinced that human emissions are key cause for the changing environment. In the Paris Climate Agreement many industrial countries consent to stop reckless economic growth by penalizing or reducing environmental pollution. However, some governments, e.g. the Trump administration in the USA, and corporations, e.g. the Diesel scandal in Germany, have not understood the seriousness of the matter. <br>
    This report examines the weather change over the past hundred years in the capital of Germany, Berlin. Due to the destruction in World War II and the subsequent separation into East and West Berlin, the city’s growth in terms of population and industry got only up to speed with the German Reunification 18 years ago. The observation of a correlating development in the local weather reports could suggest that there is a causal relationship between economic growth, i.e. environmental pollution, and climate change.

<h2><a id="met">2. Method </a></h2>
    <p>The presented data set “GISS Surface Temperature Analysis” is available online on the website of the “Goddard Institute for Space Studies”. The first graph considers yearly aggregated temperature data from the Berlin weather station “Tempelhof” in the period of 1880 until 2016. The aggregation is a geometrical mean of monthly temperature measures. The second graph ….</p>

<h2><a id="resul">4. Results and Discussion</a></h2>
    <p>The first graph shows how temperature is a very fluctuating measure. Without further research it appears as the average temperature behaves cyclic with a peak every fourth year. This makes it more difficult to infer a certain temperature trend. However, the comparison of only the temperature peaks reveals a positive trend in the overall climate. A steeper increase from 1990 is not visible suggesting that temperature is not visibly affected by local industry. This goes along with the common knowledge that the temperature rise follows the erosion of the atmosphere by CO2. More industry, thus, has a global rather than a local effect on the weather. <br>
    The second graph shows …

<h2><a id="concl">5. Conclusion</a></h2>
    <p>This report presents three main findings for the city of Berlin:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The temperature increased over the past 100 years.</li>
    <li>Industry effects temperature on a global and not a local level.</li>
    <li>Within the past 100 years, the temperature fluctuation increased.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As the data was only presented in graphical form, any insightful statistical measures are missing. This makes the conclusion too some extent far reaching. Especially, when considering that scaling of axis, the choice of colors and the overall graphical presentation can mislead the reader. 
    In further research, the report should be augmented with statistical research and an additional representation of results in form of tables and scientific 	indices.
