<h2><a id="mot">1. Motivation</a></h2>
    <p>For the past decades the concern about climate change is one the most pressing issues in global politics. The vast majority of nations is convinced that human emissions are key cause for the changing environment. In the Paris Climate Agreement many industrial countries consent to stop reckless economic growth by penalizing or reducing environmental pollution. However, some governments, e.g. the Trump administration in the USA, and corporations, e.g. the Diesel scandal in Germany, have not understood the seriousness of the matter. <br>
    This report examines the weather change over the past hundred years in the capital of Germany, Berlin. Due to the destruction in World War II and the subsequent separation into East and West Berlin, the city’s growth in terms of population and industry got only up to speed with the German Reunification 18 years ago. The observation of a correlating development in the local weather reports could suggest that there is a causal relationship between economic growth, i.e. environmental pollution, and climate change.
    </p>
<h2><a id="met">2. Method </a></h2>
    <p>The presented data set “GISS Surface Temperature Analysis” is available online on the website of the “Goddard Institute for Space Studies”. The first graph considers yearly aggregated temperature data from the Berlin weather station “Tempelhof” in the period of 1880 until 2016. The aggregation is a geometrical mean of monthly temperature measures. The second graph ….</p>

    <p>Line + standard deviation plot</p>
    <svg style="width:760px; height:316px" id="plot2"></svg>
<h2><a id="resul">4. Results and Discussion</a></h2>
    <p>The first graph shows how temperature is a very fluctuating measure.
        Without further research it appears as the average temperature behaves cyclic with a peak every fourth year.
        This makes it more difficult to infer a certain temperature trend.
        However, the comparison of only the temperature peaks reveals a positive trend in the overall climate.
        A steeper increase from 1990 is not visible suggesting that temperature is not visibly affected by local industry.
        This goes along with the common knowledge that the temperature rise follows the erosion of the atmosphere by CO2.
        More industry, thus, has a global rather than a local effect on the weather. <br>
        However, we still need a more large scale view to make a scientific statement.
        The second graph reduces the fluctuations by binning the years into decades and plotting the mean temperature
        including the standard deviation (above and below the mean).
        And indeed there is a visible trend of rising means while the standard deviation stays approximately the same.
    </p>
<h2><a id="concl">5. Conclusion</a></h2>
    <p>This report presents three main findings for the city of Berlin:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The temperature increased over the past 100 years.</li>
    <li>Industry effects temperature on a global and not a local level.</li>
    <li>Within the past 100 years, the temperature fluctuation increased.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As the data was only presented in graphical form, any insightful statistical measures are missing. This makes the conclusion too some extent far reaching. Especially, when considering that scaling of axis, the choice of colors and the overall graphical presentation can mislead the reader. 
    In further research, the report should be augmented with statistical research and an additional representation of results in form of tables and scientific 	indices.

<h1> TASK 3 </h1>


<h3>Which data set (that is realistically possible for you to obtain) and visualization would you include to give a more
    confident answer to the article’s main question? (Johannes)</h3>

<p>Weather is not only about changes in temperature, but also about how dry, stormy or cloudy it is. Climate change is
    said to result in higher temperatures, more intense heatwaves, increased sea levels and stronger hurricanes (<a
            href="https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/">NASA</a>). It would thus be helpful to include more data to get a
    fuller depiction of the weather situation over the years in a specific city or a country as a whole. More data to
    analyse the weather in Germany can be obtained from <a href="https://www.dwd.de/DE/klimaumwelt/cdc/cdc_node.html">DWD</a>.
    A visualisation as shown before should then not only include temperature values but also humidity values and/or
    depict more unusual events like very intense storms or heatwaves. This could be in rather simple and static forms
    such as bar plots, but also in more interactive ways as can be seen on <a
            href="https://www.ventusky.com/?p=52.444;13.357;9&l=clouds">here</a>. Additionally, it might be helpful to
    provide readers with a clear message, i.e. percentage values showing how much temperatures increased since the
    1980s. When analysing the weather in a city one must also consider changes over the years which might influence
    the measurement of temperatures, e.g. density and height of buildings.
</p>
<br>

<h3>So far we've only taught static visualizations. Which dynamic elements or interactions could improve your article?
    (Mona)</h3>
<p>A dynamic heatmap looking similar to the one found <a
        href="http://www.theinformationlab.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sc_surf_data_14.gif">here</a> but changing
    over the different years may be helpful to get a better understanding of changing temperatures. Additionally, an
    interactivity similar to the one on <a href="https://www.ventusky.com/?p=52.444;13.357;9&l=clouds">here</a> might
    help to provide users with more information on request without making the visualisation too complex and hard to
    understand. Thus, users could not only receive information on temperatures, but also on precipitation or the wind
    speed for example. The visualisation should be interactive in a way that users could zoom in, select a
    time period, adjust the speed at which it goes through the years and adjust what is supposed to be depicted
    (temperatures, precipitation, etc.). If the focus of the article was to show that temperatures have risen since the
    1980s, one could also consider a visualisation as found on <a
            href="http://mashable.com/2016/05/10/visualization-global-warming/#SCM4EqCXRgq3">here</a>, which dynamically
    illustrates changes in temperature over different months and years in a very clear and easy-to-understand way.</p>
<br>

<h3>How big data sets are reasonable to load in d3 visualizations? What types of visualizations does a limit like that
    exclude? Give examples of visualizations that must be based on large data sets and discuss how they deal with this.
    Could you have reduced the size of the data sets in this assignment? (Tobi)</h3>
<p>When making visualisation on the web, one must not only keep in mind the experience of the user, but also how much
    data can be displayed in a browser / loading times. In cases of much data, which would be necessary for huge maps
    displaying different aspects of the weather data on a daily or even more frequent basis to smoothly display changes
    over multiple years, one might face technical issues. In such cases one must reflect how detailed the information
    has got to be to portray relevant information in enough detail. It may be sufficient to display fewer years or
    decrease the frequency without reducing the information content massively. We have used yearly and decade averages and thus
    dropped a lot of data for visualisation, which may have made our visualisation easier to understand, but also
    removed quite a lot of information. Further reductions don't seem reasonable. Another way than using less data is
    to reduce page loading times when working with D3 through pre-rendering, i.e. shifting part of the work from the
    client-side to the server-side. For more information read <a
            href="https://mango-is.com/blog/engineering/pre-render-d3-js-charts-at-server-side/">this</a>.
