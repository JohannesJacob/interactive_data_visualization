<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The last years in Europe have been marked by an ongoing news coverage of terror attacks by Islamist terrorists
as well as xenophobic motivated attacks on refugee accommodations.
We have set out to find answers to the following questions:
<ol>
    <li>Are there specific areas that suffer more often from
        (specific kinds of) terror attacks than others?</li>
    <li>Are there differences in the amount of attacks, in the kind of
        attacks and in the concerned areas?</li>
    <li>Which actors occur? What attacks are they responsible for?
        Are there changes over the years? Are they active in specific areas?</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a database including information on
    terrorist events around the world from 1970 to 2016. It includes data on domestic, transnational and international
    terrorist incidents and provides relevant information, such as the date, location, weapons, target and the
    responsible person or group if known. The global terrorism database was introduced in 2001 at the University of
    Maryland. It is provided by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)
    which still works in close collaboration with multiple researchers from the University of Maryland.
    The data is based on publicly available, open-source materials and can be downloaded <a
            href="https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/contact/">here</a> on GTD's website.
    Incidents have been included if they met START's definition of terrorism as an "intentional act of violence or threat of violence by a non-state actor" and at least two of the following criteria:
<ol>
    <li>The violent act was aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal</li>
    <li>The violent act included evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) other than the immediate victims </li>
    <li>The violent act was outside the precepts of International Humanitarian Law.</li>
</ol>
