<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
<h2>Johannes Jacob, Tobias Ludwig, Mona Timmermann</h2>
<br>
<div class="page-wrap">

The goal of the final project is to visualise data on terrorist
attacks in Europe. The visualisations are supposed to help answer the
following questions:
<ol>
    <li>Are there specific areas (also: Western vs. Eastern) that suffer more often from
    (specific kinds of) terrorist attacks than others?</li>
    <li>Are there differences in the amount of attacks, in the kind of
        attacks and in their concerned areas?</li>
    <li>Which actors occur? What attacks are they responsible for?
    Are there changes over the years? Are they active in specific areas?</li>
</ol>

The data set we are planning to work with is the <a href="https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">Global Terrorism Database (GTD)</a>.
    While they have tried to visualise the data in some ways on their website, they seem to have rather small,
    unconnected, non-interactive ways which does not give their data justice.

We hope to be able to answer as many of the listed questions as possible using this data.

Possible ways of visualising the data would be to:
    <ul>
        <li>Map of Europe</li>
        <li>Terrorist attacks as circles where they appeared</li>
        <li>Colouring of attack circles depending on the category of attack</li>
        <li>Display of more information when hovering over circles in side panel for example,
            including the number of victims, a summary of the case and the actors</li>
        <li>Time slider to filter a range of a time period</li>
        <li>Possibly a selection box to filter by the actors for example, if the data allows to do that.
        Grouping might be needed and there might be too many cases where actors are unknown.</li>
        <li>A rather simple line plot to give a brief overview of the numbers of terror attacks over time.</li>
    </ul>
